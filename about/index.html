My work as a graphic designer departs from a wider interest in language and communication. <em> “The language needed in order to redistribute somebody else's work, and the attention towards that kind of language”</em> – W.H.

“The space between two languages, is a space like no other” writes poet and scholar Anne Carson. It is this liminal space of translation, that sustains my interest in graphic design as a craft and a form of expression.  

The close readings and conversations generated by the process of designing/editing, becomes a way of paying attention in a world completely oversaturated by visual information. 

To work from a method and an attitude, rather than based on a certain “style” which is then imposed on the material. (One of the biggest compliments I have yet received, was that of a former classmate, when she said that she could hardly tell if something was designed by me, by judging only from the way it looked.)  

Sketching on a visual identity for a contemporary art exhibition, and finding myself making something that looks like it came out of an old DIY Hippie-journal from the 70s. Although I like the way it looks, and despite that it does have at least some kind of relation to the wider context of the exhibition, I still have a nagging feeling that I have lured myself into a trap – mirroring certain aesthetic archetypes of the past (that emerged out a different cultural and technological state) and “reintroducing” them in the present moment, as a kind of visual trick. A feeling of lacking solid ground beneath my feet. Digging out one obscure and/or “forgotten” typeface after another from books and websites. Getting inspiration from designs made by hand on typewriters and phototypesetting machines, while working almost exclusively in Indesign. Shopping/stealing from all the stylistic shelves and working closely and intensely – committed to “getting it right”, yet also ending up with something that feels weirdly disconnected from myself. A pastiche. To speak of that which is contemporary – does this mean anything made now?

Too many references, consumed too fast. Too much knowledge on what everybody else is doing – or has (just) done. 

Harun Farocki: “You don't have to search for new images, ones never seen before, but you do have to utilize the existing ones in such a way that they become new” (from: Imprint / Nachdruck)

Harun Farocki: “Today I can hardly write a word, if there isn't an image on the screen at the same time” (from: Schnittstelle / Interface, 1995)

Thinking about how practical constraints (budgets, deadlines, technologies) and various forms of distance (cultural, historical, geographical) seeps into the visual form. E.g.:

“Tucked away in the stacks were faded copies of the 'Ashanti Pioneer', a pre-independence newspaper subsequently suppressed by Kwame Nkrumah. At some point the paper had begun to run out of typefaces and wasn't in a position to replace them. So the typesetters simply put whatever they had into the type boxes. In any given word there could be a mix of bold, italic and indeed entirely different fonts.” (Ormond Simpson in: The London Review of Books, 2025)

“Filmmaking [and designing, ed.] should just remain a way of life sometimes, like taking a walk, reading a newspaper, eating, writing notes, driving a car, or shooting this film here, for instance, from day to day, carried along by nothing other than its curiosity.” (Wim Wenders in: Notebook on Cities and Clothes, 1989)</p>
