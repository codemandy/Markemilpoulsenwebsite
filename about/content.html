This page is an ongoing work document, and a space for occasional notes and textual fragments that interests me in relation to graphic design. [last edited in July 2025]

My work as a graphic designer departs from a wider interest in language and communication: 'The language needed in order to redistribute somebody else's work, and the attention towards that kind of language' (Will Holder)

– 

Talking to a friend about the minute details in our work, that nobody is likely to notice, but we nonetheless put care and effort into. His remark that that there is an almost spiritual dimension to this kind of labour – that we charge the objects we make with the attention we put into them. 

–

I think a lot about attention – in my own work and in that of others. Feeling guilt for the kind of short-term memory and attention span that present day technologies impose on my being.

'I actually am a great fan of aesthetics and thinking about things formalistically and making aesthetic judgements. But there are times when I think it is inappropriate to do that, particularly when aesthetic judgements are used as a way of obscuring information that deserves to be heard and grasped on its own.' (Adrian Piper)

Thinking about how practical constraints (budgets, deadlines, technologies) and various forms of distance (cultural, historical, geographical) becomes part of the design. For example: 'Tucked away in the stacks were faded copies of the Ashanti Pioneer, a pre-independence newspaper subsequently suppressed by Kwame Nkrumah. At some point the paper had begun to run out of typefaces and wasn't in a position to replace them. So the typesetters simply put whatever they had into the type boxes. In any given word there could be a mix of bold, italic and indeed entirely different fonts.' (Ormond Simpson in: The London Review of Books, spring 2025)

'As I began to see injustice close up, I was filled with a desire to understand what made people who had suffered for nothing want to go on living. I became uncomfortable with what was given to me as a birthright and what later came to be understood (be me and my culture) as meaning: White. White meant adult, condescending, cold, pale, driven, individualist, judging, and theoretical. White meant distant, detached, ironic, skeptical, ambitious, Protestant.' (Fanny Howe)
