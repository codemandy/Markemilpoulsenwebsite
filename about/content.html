Currently working on a label for a perfume, in collaboration with an artist. The scent is inspired by the kind of loose objects that accumulates at the bottom of a handbag: Spare change, pins, makeup, receipts etc.. I find receipts interesting to consider from a design point of view. They are, on one hand, completely anonymous objects, with quite uniform stylistic conventions, regardless if they document the transaction of groceries or luxury goods. The typeface always appears to be the same. The format, and the paper too. And from this widespread repetition, one ceases to recognize the specificity of its visual language. It is simply 'just there'. However, one could also look at receipts as highly designed objects, in their particular composition and organization of the information they convey. The distinctions between left, right and center alignment, and the presence of lines and tabular increments in order to guide the reading in a most economical and precise way. The thin coated paper and the quickly fading print, being the result of a particular ink-less printing technology, and a demand for this printed object to have variable lengths, while being able to slip easily into a box, or bag or pocket without taking up unnecessary space. 

As part of my research, I wanted to look into the kind of typefaces that one would commonly associate with a receipt, realizing that this has as much to do with the 'dot matrix' translation of the thermal printer, as it has with the forms of the actual typeface itself. Along the way, I stumbled on a font which is a digital interpretation of a scanned receipt. In other words, by using it, one can 'fake' the appearance of something printed on a thermal printer. 

Working with this font, made me think of a feeling that I often have: a kind of doubt that arise when one is mimicking the appearance of an image, that references a particular era, or technology by digital means only. I'm not against this, necessarily (I do it all the time...) but it does make me question how one arrives at an image today. The ability to copy from all kinds of styles and eras in an instant, without having to engage with the actual means of production that gave way to this aesthetic in the first place. 

Discussing this with the artist, we considered acquiring a thermal printer (they are not very expensive), or to scan whatever receipts we had in our wallets and extract the letters from those – in order to situate
