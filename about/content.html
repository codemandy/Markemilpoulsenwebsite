My work as a graphic designer departs from a wider interest in language and communication. 
I'm interested in thinking about designing as a form of translation. And in the multiple points in which language (in the widest possible sense of the word) is made visual, and public. “No community without communication” (Ferdinand Kriwet)

“The space between two languages is a space like no other” writes poet and translator Anne Carson. What happens in this contingent “in between” is what sustains my interest in graphic design as both a craft and a form of expression. 

The joy (fx.) in seeing how different kinds of language can come together on the page (or screen, or street...)

The way in which the close readings and care that informs the process of designing, becomes a mode of being present – of paying attention – in a society inflated by visual information.

What matters is the content and its context. As well as the context that the work itself creates. The conversations and relationships it generates, and how these feed into the visual form – directly and indirectly.

I'm interested in how specific constraints such as budgets, deadlines and various forms of distance (geographically, culturally, historically etc.) becomes part of the design. Looking at the limitations they impose as a productive force – something to situate the work in relation to – rather than something to work against. No work exists in a vacuum.

I'm interested in looking at typefaces as historical objects, made at specific moments in time, by specific people, as much as I am drawn to the visual connotations and references that has accumulated through their usage over time – independently (it often seems) from the particular context and/or purpose in which they were initially conceived.
