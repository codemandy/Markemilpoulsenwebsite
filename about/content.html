This page is a space for (occasional) written notes related to my design practice

My work as a graphic designer departs from a wider interest in language and communication. <em> “The language needed in order to redistribute somebody else's work, and the attention towards that kind of language”</em> – W.H.

<em>“The space between two languages, is a space like no other”</em> writes poet and scholar Anne Carson. It is this liminal space of translation – how “something” is articulated visually – that sustains my interest in graphic design as a craft and a form of expression.  

Talking with a friend about the minute details that “nobody will notice” and yet that we, nonetheless put care and effort into. His remark that that there is an almost spiritual aspect to this kind of labour. That we charge the objects we make with the attention we put into them. 

The close readings and conversations generated by the process of designing/editing, as a way of being present in a world completely oversaturated by (visual) information. 

To work from an editorial position, rather than based on a certain visual “style” which is then imposed on the material. (It was a compliment when a former classmate said that she could hardly tell if something was designed by me, if based only on the way it looked.) It is the material that generates the visual form.

Working on a visual identity for a (contemporary) art exhibition, and finding myself making sketches that resembles an old Hippie-journal from the 70s. Although I'm interested in the way it looks, and despite that it hase at least a vague relation to the wider context of the exhibition, I still have a nagging feeling that I have lured myself into a trap – mirroring certain aesthetic archetypes of the past (that emerged out a different cultural and technological state) and “reintroducing” them in the present moment, as a kind of visual trick. A feeling of lacking solid ground beneath my feet. Digging out one obscure and/or “forgotten” typeface after another from books and websites. Getting inspiration from designs made by hand, on typewriters and phototypesetting machines, while working almost exclusively in Indesign. The feeling that one is able to shop/steal from all the stylistic shelves in an instant, and despite working closely and intensely – committed to “getting it right” – also ending up with something that feels weirdly disconnected from myself. A pastiche. Is it the ease with which the available softwares and technologies allows me to (re-)produce images that makes them feel somehow not “grounded”? To speak of that which is contemporary – does this mean anything made now?

Spending hours messing around with applying various textures to an image; bitmapping and inverting, layering in order to make it appear somehow less “digital” (although every step of the process is exactly that). Or in order to exorcise some kind of authorship? Somehow the translation is important.  

Harun Farocki: <em>“You don't have to search for new images, ones never seen before, but you do have to utilize the existing ones in such a way that they become new”</em> (from: Imprint / Nachdruck)

Too many images, consumed too fast. Too much knowledge on what everybody else is doing – or has (just) done. 

Harun Farocki: <em>“Today I can hardly write a word, if there isn't an image on the screen at the same time”</em> (from: Schnittstelle / Interface, 1995)

Thinking about how practical constraints (budgets, deadlines, technologies) and various forms of distance (cultural, historical, geographical) seeps into the visual form. E.g.:

<em>“Tucked away in the stacks were faded copies of the 'Ashanti Pioneer', a pre-independence newspaper subsequently suppressed by Kwame Nkrumah. At some point the paper had begun to run out of typefaces and wasn't in a position to replace them. So the typesetters simply put whatever they had into the type boxes. In any given word there could be a mix of bold, italic and indeed entirely different fonts.”</em> (Ormond Simpson in: The London Review of Books, 2025)

–

<em>“Filmmaking should just remain a way of life sometimes, like taking a walk, reading a newspaper, eating, writing notes, driving a car, or shooting this film here, for instance, from day to day, carried along by nothing other than its curiosity.”</em> (Wim Wenders in: Notebook on Cities and Clothes, 1989)
