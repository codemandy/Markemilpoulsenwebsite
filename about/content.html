My work as a graphic designer departs from a wider interest in language and communication. 
I'm interested in thinking about designing as a form of translation. And in the multiple points in which language (in the widest possible sense) is made visual, and public. “No community without communication” (Ferdinand Kriwet)

“The space between two languages is a space like no other” writes poet and translator Anne Carson. What happens in this contingent “in between” is what sustains my interest in graphic design as both a craft and a form of expression. 

The exitement (fx.) in seeing how different kinds of language can come together on the page (or screen, or street...)

The way in which the close readings and discussions that informs the process of designing, becomes a mode of being present – of paying attention – in a society inflated by visual information. 

Talking with a friend about the parts of our craft that we continue to put care and effort into, despite knowing that they will likely go unnoticed by most people in the end. His remark that there is an almost metaphysical aspect to these minute details; that we charge the objects we make with the attention we put into them. 

What matters is the content. It is the specific language of the content and its context that drives the work. As well as the context that the work itself creates. The conversations and relationships it generates, and how these feed into the visual form – directly and indirectly.

I'm interested in how practical and/or external constraints such as (amongst others) budgets, deadlines and various forms of distance (geographically, culturally, historically etc.) become part of the design. For example this anecdote from the University Library in Kumasi, Ghana: “Tucked away in the stacks were faded copies of the 'Ashanti Pioneer', a pre-independence newspaper subsequently suppressed by Kwame Nkrumah. At some point the paper had begun to run out of typefaces and wasn't in a position to replace them. So the typesetters simply put whatever they had into the type boxes. In any given word there could be a mix of bold, italic and indeed entirely different fonts.” (Ormond Simpson, London Review of Books)

To work in a way that is open to chance. Adapting to the noise and friction of the material and that of working with other people, instead of trying to “master” the work, imposing a certain “style”. 

Nothing comes from nothing. No work exists in a vacuum.

I'm interested in looking at typefaces as historical objects, made at specific moments in time, by specific people, as much as I am drawn to the visual connotations and references that has accumulated through their use over time – independently (it often seems) from the particular context and/or purpose in which they were initially conceived.

“To abstain from clear visualization of a future is to endure uncertainty. But it is also to level oneself with a rich and open future, with the seeds of the world, with possibility itself. And thereby we might acknowledge an accelerated version of hope that does not hope for something in particular, but rather prepares us to be trustful of what will emerge, unknown and unknowable, in its absolute newness. Thus, and only thus, we might keep open the opportunity of everything that exceeds our wildest expectations. And by such a faithful approach, maybe – maybe – we shall manage to sustain a rich and abundant present, a world in the proper sense of the world, in which anything is possible and things can actually take place.” (Peter Møller Rasmussen, The Law of Vacant Places: Visiting Dinesen's Archive)
